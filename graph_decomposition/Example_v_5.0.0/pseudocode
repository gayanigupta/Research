1. Initialize an empty set Q1 and Q2.
2. For each vertex v in the graph:
   - Find the lowest parent w of v.
   - If w is not empty:
     - Set LP[v] to w.
     - If w is not in Q1:
       - Add w to Q1.
       - Set C[v] to an empty set.
3. While Q1 is not empty:
   - Create a new empty set newQ1.
   - For each vertex v in Q1:
     - For each neighbor w of v:
       - If LP[w] is equal to v and C[w] is a subset of C[v]:
         - Add w to the chordal set of v (C[v]).
         - Add the edge (v, w) to the chordal edges (EC).
         - Add w to newQ1.
   - Set Q1 to newQ1.
4. Find the nodes without parents:
   - For each vertex v in the graph:
     - If LP[v] is -1:
       - Add v to the set of nodes without parents.
   - For each node v in the set of nodes without parents:
     - If v is chordal with another node:
       - Eliminate the chordal node first.
5. Return the chordal edges (EC) and the elimination order.
