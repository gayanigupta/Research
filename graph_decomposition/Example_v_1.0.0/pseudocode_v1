1. Take graph
2. Store the graph in adjacency list
3. store the graph as node using the following steps
  - start from zero node
  - Find all the neighbors of the selected node
  - Create a tree node that's the node and all the neighbors ( A tree node is a struct with more than one vertex)
4. Select the next node from the graph and continue step 3
- Connect the tree nodes together by finding a common vertex
- In order to select the next node always select from the current node list you had take
